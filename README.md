# _octseq_ - Generic Octets Sequences

Such sequences require a varying amount of memory and different use cases
suggest different strategies to manage that memory: references to `u8`
slices, `Vec<u8>`, `Arc<[u8]>` are examples provided by the standard library.

In many cases, underlying memory management strategies donâ€™t matter for
composite types storing such octets sequences or for code manipulating
them. Instead of insisting on a specific representation, these types and
functions can be generic over the representation and describe the
necessary properties through trait bounds.

This crate provides a set of such traits that describe basic functionality
of octets sequences as well as buffers to construct such sequences,
termed _octets builders,_ conversions between sequences and builders.

It also provides some helper types that simplify common tasks such as
parsing data from an octets sequence.

For details, please see the [crate documentation on
docs.rs](https://docs.rs/octseq).
